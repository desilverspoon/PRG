Player Rating Grabber

The Player Rating Grabber is a Python-based tool designed to extract, track, and visualize player ratings from online profiles. It automates the process of fetching player ratings from a specified URL, saving the data to a CSV file, and generating a graph to display rating trends over time.

To change the player URL simply navigate to leetify.com/app/profile/GRAB_YOUR_ID_AND_PASTE_IT_HERE

CSSTATS will be enabled in future updates, for now, data is pulled from Leetify. In order to change the premier rank between colors, you will need to fetch the hosted static image from CSSTATS through inspect element:

You will need to download and install Python, Selenium and ChromeDriver

Ensure you know the directories you are installing files; pathing is vitally important.

The tool will fetch new data every 30 minutes to allow for real-time updates to your rating while you stream. To cancel the process just press Ctrl+C

Rating.html will contain the overlay source to allow you to utilize a custom widget with StreamLabs Desktop. For now, you will need to manually edit your rating but future updates will have automation.

Auto Installation will be in the next update.
