Player Rating Grabber

The Player Rating Grabber is a Python-based tool designed to extract, track, and visualize player ratings from online profiles. It automates the process of fetching player ratings from a specified URL, saving the data to a CSV file, and generating a graph to display rating trends over time.

You will need to download and install Python and Selenium and ChromeDriver

Ensure you know the directories you are installing files; pathing is vitally important.

The tool will fetch new data every 30 minutes to allow for real-time updates to your rating while you stream. To cancel the process just press Ctrl+C

To change the player URL simply navigate to leetify.com/app/profile/GRAB_YOUR_ID_AND_PASTE_IT_HERE

Rating.html will contain the overlay source to allow you to utilize a custom widget with StreamLabs Desktop. For now, you will need to manually edit your rating but future updates will have automation.
